Heart murmur, defined as heart sounds produced by the turbulent blood flow through the heart, is a common clinical indicator in pediatric cardiology \cite{Masic_2018}. Accurate detection of heart murmurs and distinguishment between innocent murmurs and pathological murmurs help early clinical intervention of vital heart diseases such as congenital heart diseases, hence having a significant medical value.

Based on such motivations, the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 \cite{goldberger2000physionet,cinc2022} raised questions about detecting heart murmurs and identifying abnormal cardiac functions from phonocardiograms (PCGs), which are non-invasive heart sound recordings collected from multiple auscultation locations. In this paper, we present our methods of tackling these problems.
