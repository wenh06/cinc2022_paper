The Challenge scores (weighted accuracy for murmur detection and cost for clinical outcome identification) with an extra metric of weighted accuracy for clinical outcome identification on the train, validation \ref{subsec:training}, and hidden validation sets are gathered in Table \ref{tab:challenge_scores}. Scores on the former two sets are provided with mean and standard deviation over most of our offline experiments searching for the best neural network architecture \ref{subsec:backbone}, \ref{subsec:mtl}, and loss functions \ref{subsec:training}.
